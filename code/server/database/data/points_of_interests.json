    "description": "Rome's finest private collection of art is displayed in the magnificent Baroque galleries, state rooms, and chapel of the Palazzo Doria Pamphilj. Representing works by European masters from the 15th through the 18th centuries, the collections include paintings by Filippo Lippi, Brueghel the Elder, Correggio, and Raphael, along with major works by Caravaggio (Rest in the Flight into Egypt) and Titian (Salome with the Head of John the Baptist). Velázquez's Portrait of Innocent X is one of the collection's highlights. Another image of the same Pope is a sculpture by Bernini. The palace itself almost outshines its contents, with frescoed ceilings and Baroque decoration; a good audio guide in English enlivens the tour. The gardens are beautiful, with an intricately patterned parterre with labyrinth elements.",

You can descend from the 12th-century church into a previous church, a 4th-century basilica with Romanesque frescoes of New Testament scenes. Below that are the excavated foundations of a Roman home from the 2nd century AD, with a shrine to the sun god Mithra, with a carved relief on the altar. From the foundations of the house, you can walk on ancient streets of this former Roman neighborhood. But do take time to look around the upper church, to see the mosaics, the inlaid marble floors, and the early Renaissance frescoes by Masolino in the St. Catherine's Chapel.",

After centuries of alterations, it still retains its original form from the age of Constantine, when it was built. Its façade, by contrast, is a purely Baroque embellishment and a fine example of that period. Along with the mosaics in the apse, be sure to notice the beautiful 16th-century wooden ceiling. If the octagonal baptistery, San Giovanni in Fonte, looks a bit familiar, it's because it provided the model for later ones throughout Europe. Built by Constantine, it is the world's oldest Christian baptistery. Across the piazza, in the church of the Scala Santa, is the Holy Staircase, 28 steps believed to have been brought to Rome in the fourth century by St. Helen, from Pilate's palace in Jerusalem.",
